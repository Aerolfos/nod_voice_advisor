- Backend Github changes
- Upgrade workshop description with proper assets, match format for other mods of mine

- Fix nod advisor lines category being wrong, they should be controllable with "Voice" slider again
---

---
## Nod Virtual Assistant `1.2.1`:
- Support for Stellaris 3.11

- Add notifications for new agenda available and legendary leader appearance
- Clean up main asset file a bit
---

---
## Nod Virtual Assistant `1.2.0`:
- Change mod structure - now nesting mod files inside folder that acts as github repo and can contain development assets without pushing to users
- Much better for development
- Add license and gitignore
---

---
## Nod Virtual Assistant `1.1.1`:
- Update description to note (tested) 3.7 support
---

---
## Nod Virtual Assistant `1.1.0`:
- Update descriptor to list supported Stellaris version as `3.*.*` - tested with 3.6
- Don't have to keep doing minor updates just for the launcher this way - advisors and sound format don't change much in Stellaris and keep working without updates usually
- Big refactoring and internal changes to mod files, much cleaner
- Now properly adds multiple potential voice lines for advisor events where appropriate and not just where vanilla happened to have multiple already
- (Because I actually understand how soundeffects and soundeffectoverrides work now rather than just copy-pasting, don't tell anyone)
