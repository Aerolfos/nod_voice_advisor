This mod is likely to work beyond its latest updated version, so long as Stellaris does not receive a major update to advisor formats. It should also still work just fine for lower versions down to 2.0 at least, despite raising a warning in the launcher.

If your launcher does claim incompatibility for a current version, try resubscribing to the mod on the workshop first - mods do not always update properly.

An EVA fit for the true believers. Features quotes from Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath, covering all voice advisor notifications.

(Almost) Guaranteeed to contain no traces of evil computer assisted biologically augmented lifeforms.
